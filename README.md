## Context
Git is a version control software and can run it on anywhere you want. It allows to track your history of a project and it allows you to collaborate with others, while Github is a web service where you make an account and do projects that have git in them.  

You can add a repository (repo for short) which is another word for project. It can include multiple files in it. When you create a repository, it has a checbox that says **README** which is the description and intro of the repository.  

You can also add a file and write anything on it. There is also a commit button which is a commit that allows the file to save its work. It also has a version history for each commit you can go to and it will highlight where you changed the repository. The commit hash is like an identifier for each commits.
